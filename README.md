HoloInventory Reloaded - A Minecraft mod for holographic inventory display.

[中文](README_cn.md) | English

This mod is a high-version remaster of [**HoloInventory**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/holoinventory). When you point your cursor at a container (such as chests and hoppers), it will display the items inside the container above it.
